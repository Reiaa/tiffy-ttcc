# How to test your thingies
- Go to https://discordapp.com/developers
- Make a new application and name it whatever you want
- Go to the 'Bot' tab on the left side
- In the 'Build-A-Bot' section, click 'Add bot', then confirm
- Under your bot's username, you should see a 'token' that you can reveal and copy, in your bot's directory, go to the config folder, and add a file named 'token.txt' and paste your bot's token in there
- Now you need to add your bot to a server to test, in order to do this, go to the OAuth2 tab above the Bot tab, and click the 'bot' checkbox in the scopes section
- This will give you a link that when clicked, will let you invite your bot to your server
- Run AscendedBot.py and then you're done
